    <h1>My name is Cameron Pearson</h1>
    <p>
      I am a student at Wake Tech Community College. I work full-time at an auto shop as a sales rep. I am also soon to be a father in November of a baby girl.  <br>
      When I do have free time, I use it to study and play a few computer games every once in a while. The new Rainbow Six Siege is out, and I have been enjoying the new game. <br>
      My all-time favorite thing to do is to stay home all day and not spend a penny. I hate spending money!
