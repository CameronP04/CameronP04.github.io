# Hello all, my name is Cameron, and I'm a new student at Wake Tech
## I am very interested in cars and building computers. I am more of a hardware geek than a software geek. To me, computers are like Legos in a way. Just putting things together one piece at a time.
## I do have a couple of websites I recommend for computer builders and car enthusiasts
[RockAuto](https://www.rockauto.com/) I like this website for many reasons. For one, it shows you all the car parts that are made for your specific car and gives you options for what you need.

[PCPartPicker](https://pcpartpicker.com/) This is another website I love to use. It gives me all the information I need to put together a computer. It tells me if parts are compatible, what kind of power will be used during operation, and way more. It is an awesome site to use for anyone wanting to learn more about computer hardware.
